# issue reporter
 Simple Python application to automate entry for issues.
 Python application using tkinter which:
 Checks for an existing txt file with the days date as part of the file name
 if one already exists, adds the issue to the end of the file
 if it doesn't, a new one is created and the issue added to it.
 
 Two separate files are created based on the information in "forwarded?" field. If "yes" is entered, txt file name is "Forwarded_dd_mm_yyyy", if field does not contain "yes", txt file name is "inProgress_dd_mm_yyyy"
